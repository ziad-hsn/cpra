Components contain the data associated to your game or simulation entities.
This chapter explains how to manipulate them.
For general information on components, see section [Components](../concepts#components) in chapter [Concepts](../concepts).

## Component mappers

Component mappers {{< api ecs Map1 >}}, {{< api ecs Map2 >}} etc.
are helpers that allow to create entities with components,
to add components to entities, and to remove components from entities.
They are parametrized by the component types they handle.

{{< code-func operations_test.go TestComponentMapper >}}

In this example, the `2` in {{< api ecs NewMap2 >}} denotes the number of mapped components.
Unfortunately, this is required due to the limitations of Go's generics.

In addition to {{< api ecs Map1 >}}, {{< api ecs Map2 >}}, etc., there is {{< api ecs Map >}}.
It is a dedicated mapper for a single component and provides a few additional methods.

## Component access

Component mappers are also used to access components for specific entities:

{{< code-func operations_test.go TestComponentMapperGet >}}

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The component pointers obtained should never be stored
> outside of the current context, as they are not persistent inside the world.

## Component exchange

Adding and removing components are relatively costly operations,
as entities and their components must be moved between [archetypes](../architecture).
It is most efficient to perform component additions and removals in a single operation,
instead of using multiple operations.

For that sake, Ark provides {{< api ecs Exchange1 >}}, {{< api ecs Exchange2 >}} etc.,
to do additions and removals in one go.
It adds the components given by the generics, and removes those specified with {{< api ecs Exchange2.Removes >}}.

{{< code-func operations_test.go TestExchange >}}
