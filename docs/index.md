# CPRA Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for CPRA, a high-performance, event-driven monitoring application designed for massive-scale environments.

## What is CPRA?

CPRA (Concurrent Pulse-Remediation-Alerting) is a monitoring system built in Go. It is designed to be highly scalable, performant, and resilient. It uses a data-oriented Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture to efficiently manage over one million concurrent monitors.

## Key Features

*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle over one million concurrent monitors.
*   **High Performance:** Optimized for high throughput and low latency.
*   **Resilience:** Designed to be resilient to failures, with automated recovery and remediation mechanisms.
*   **Modularity:** The ECS architecture makes the system highly modular and extensible.

## Getting Started

If you're new to CPRA, we recommend starting with our [Getting Started](./tutorials/getting-started.md) guide.

## Architecture
