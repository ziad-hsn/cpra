// ADAPTER PATTERN REMOVED - This file contained a commented-out adapter pattern 
// that was replaced by direct ECS component access in the systems.
// The adapter pattern added unnecessary complexity for this use case.
// If needed in the future, consider implementing a simplified adapter 
// with proper error handling and validation.
